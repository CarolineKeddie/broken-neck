# Web Scraping Job Postings
How to fix a broken neck whilst webscraping salaries from indeed.com using Beautiful Soup



You're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Now that they have their most valuable employee (you!), they need to leverage data to win more contracts. Your firm offers technology and scientific solutions and wants to be competitive in the hiring market. Your principal has two main objectives:

   1. Determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts for these data.
   2. Determine the factors that distinguish job categories and titles from each other. For example, can required skills accurately predict job title?

To limit the scope, your principal has suggested that you *focus on data-related job postings*, e.g. data scientist, data analyst, research scientist, business intelligence, and any others you might think of. You may also want to decrease the scope by *limiting your search to a single region.*

Hint: Aggregators like [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) regularly pool job postings from a variety of markets and industries.

**Goal:** Scrape your own data from a job aggregation tool like Indeed.com in order to collect the data to best answer these two questions.
